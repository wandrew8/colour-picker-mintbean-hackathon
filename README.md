# Palette Generator

## About the Project
This project was built for a mintbean hackathon on July 22nd 2020. The objective for this hackathon was to built upon an existing color generator application. I added a number of new features including the ability to switch between hex and RGB values, a swatch component to select preset colors, the ability to copy color values to the clipboard, and many styling upgrades.
